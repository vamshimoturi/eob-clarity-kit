# Monthly EOB Clarity Clinic

Submit a **synthetic** snippet (no names, no account numbers, no IDs).
I review it using **Standard v1** and publish the best cases as structured examples.

## Submit
Submission link: **(add your Google Form / Tally link here when ready)**

## What I publish
- Document type (EOB vs bill vs statement vs collections)
- Plain-English summary + key numbers
- Next-step checklist + script-ready questions
- Red flags + what to verify

## Rules
- Synthetic only (public-safe)
- No personal identifiers
- I may edit for clarity and safety
