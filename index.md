# Vamshi Moturi

**Sr Technical Project Manager (Healthcare)**

I build privacy-first, plain-English tools that reduce confusion in healthcare admin — starting with EOBs and medical bills.

**EOB ≠ bill. No medical advice. Synthetic examples only.**

[Try the Demo](demo/) · [Read the Standard v1](docs/standard-v1.html) · [Browse Examples](examples/) · [Clinic](community/clinic.html) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.html)

## What this does

**Explain** — Plain-English summary + key numbers  
**Act** — Next steps checklist + call scripts  
**Spot errors** — Red flags: mismatched math, unclear payee, missing due date, duplicates

---

## Workflow

**Classify → Extract → Explain → Checklist → Verify**

---

## Public artifacts (evidence)

- **Demo (copy/paste workflow):** Try the demo
- **Standard v1 (rubric):** definitions + boundaries (EOB ≠ bill, no medical advice)
- **Synthetic case library:** browse examples
- **Clinic:** review process for submissions (published as synthetic cases)
- **Changelog:** version history



---

## Safety + privacy

- This project does **not** provide medical advice.
- Do **not** paste or upload personal data (names, IDs, addresses, claim/account numbers).
- Use **redacted text snippets** only.
- Synthetic examples are used to demonstrate the approach.
