# Vamshi Moturi
**Sr Technical Project Manager (Healthcare)**

I build privacy-first, plain-English tools that reduce confusion in healthcare admin — starting with EOBs and medical bills.

**EOB ≠ bill. No medical advice. Synthetic examples only.**


---

## What this does
**Explain** — Plain-English summary + key numbers  
**Act** — Next steps checklist + call scripts  
**Spot errors** — Red flags: mismatched math, unclear payee, missing due date, duplicates

---

## Workflow
**Classify → Extract → Explain → Checklist → Verify**

- **Admin clarity only.** This project does **not** provide medical advice.
- **Synthetic examples only.** Never share personal identifiers.
- **Verification-first.** Use this to confirm and ask questions before paying.
