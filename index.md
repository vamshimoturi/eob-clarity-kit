# Vamshi Moturi
**Sr Technical Project Manager (Healthcare)**

I build privacy-first, plain-English tools that reduce confusion in healthcare admin — starting with EOBs and medical bills.

**EOB ≠ bill. No medical advice. Synthetic examples only.**

[Read the Standard v1](docs/standard-v1.html) · [Browse Examples](examples/) · [Clinic](community/clinic.html) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.html)

---

## What this does
**Explain** — Plain-English summary + key numbers  
**Act** — Next steps checklist + call scripts  
**Spot errors** — Red flags: mismatched math, unclear payee, missing due date, duplicates

---

## Workflow
**Classify → Extract → Explain → Checklist → Verify**

---

## Public artifacts (evidence)
- **Standard v1 (rubric):** [Read here](docs/standard-v1.html)
- **Synthetic case library:** [Browse examples](examples/)
- **Clinic (review process):** [How submissions are reviewed](community/clinic.html)
- **Changelog (version history):** [See updates](CHANGELOG.html)

---

## Safety + privacy
- **Admin clarity only.** This project does **not** provide medical advice.
- **Synthetic examples only.** Never share real names, member IDs, account numbers, addresses, or portal screenshots.
- **Verification-first.** The output helps you confirm what’s happening and what to ask—before paying.

## What’s next
- Expand the synthetic library (5 → 25 cases)
- Add a simple “copy/paste demo” (text in → structured output out)
- Publish monthly learnings (short posts)
