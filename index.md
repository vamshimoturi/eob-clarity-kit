# EOB Clarity Kit

**Vamshi Moturi**  
Sr Technical Project Manager (Healthcare)

I build privacy-first, plain-English tools that reduce confusion in healthcare admin — starting with EOBs and medical bills.

**EOB ≠ bill. No medical advice. Synthetic examples only.**

## What this does

**Explain** — Plain-English summary + key numbers  
**Act** — Next steps checklist + call scripts  
**Spot errors** — Red flags: mismatched math, unclear payee, missing due date, duplicates

## Safety + privacy

- This project is for **admin clarity only** (billing/EOB understanding).
- **Do not paste PHI** (names, addresses, IDs, DOB, portal screenshots, QR codes).
- If anything looks wrong, **verify with the provider/insurer** before paying.
