# Example 04 — Collections notice (verify-first)

## Synthetic snippet
“Collections Notice: Balance due $320. Reference: 12345. Original creditor: ABC Hospital. Service date: 10/12/2025. Pay within 15 days to avoid further action. Call 888-000-0000.”

## What this document is
This looks like a **collections notice**. Do **not** pay immediately without verification.

## Plain-English summary
- Someone is claiming you owe $320 for a past service.
- Collections notices can be legitimate, but also contain errors or missing context.
- First step is **verification**: confirm debt validity + itemization + insurance processing history.

## Key numbers
- Claimed balance: $320  
- Service date: 10/12/2025  
- Original creditor: ABC Hospital

## What to do next (checklist)
- [ ] Ask for **written validation** of the debt (itemized details and proof).
- [ ] Confirm the original provider visit and date of service.
- [ ] Check if insurance processed the claim and whether you already paid.
- [ ] If legitimate, request itemization and negotiate payment options.

## Questions to ask (script-ready)
- “Please send debt validation in writing with itemized charges and proof this is mine.”
- “What is the original account number with the provider, and what services does this cover?”
- “Was insurance billed? If yes, what was the outcome?”

## Red flags
- Pressure to pay immediately without documentation
- No itemized breakdown or unclear original creditor details
- Contact info looks inconsistent with the stated creditor
