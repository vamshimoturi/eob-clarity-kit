# Example 02 — Provider Bill (amount due + due date)

## Synthetic snippet
“Statement from ABC Clinic. Date of service: 01/18/2026. Total charges: $250. Insurance payment: $150. Adjustments: $50. Amount due: $50. Due date: 03/01/2026. Pay online at example.com/pay. Phone: 800-000-0000.”

## What this document is
This looks like a **provider bill/statement**. It may require payment **if the details match your EOB** (if you have one).

## Plain-English summary
- The provider charged $250.
- Insurance paid $150.
- $50 was adjusted/discounted.
- The bill says **you owe $50** by **03/01/2026**.

## Key numbers
- Total charges: $250  
- Insurance paid: $150  
- Adjustments: $50  
- **Amount due: $50**  
- **Due date: 03/01/2026**

## What to do next (checklist)
- [ ] Confirm the provider name + date of service match your visit.
- [ ] If you have an EOB for this visit, confirm patient responsibility matches $50.
- [ ] If you do not have an EOB yet, call the provider and ask if insurance is fully processed.
- [ ] If paying, use official channels (provider portal/phone number on bill).

## Questions to ask (script-ready)
- “Is this claim fully processed by insurance, and is $50 the final patient responsibility?”
- “Can you confirm what the $50 is for (copay, coinsurance, or deductible)?”
- “Can I get an itemized bill for this date of service?”

## Red flags
- Missing due date or unclear payee name
- Payment link that doesn’t match provider name
- Bill arrives before insurance processing is complete
