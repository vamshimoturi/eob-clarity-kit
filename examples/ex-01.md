## What this document is
This is an **EOB (Explanation of Benefits)** — **an EOB is not a bill**.  
It is a summary of how insurance processed a claim.

## Plain-English summary
- The provider billed $1,200, but your plan only considers $520 for payment.
- Your plan paid $400.
- The remaining amount shown as **patient responsibility** is $120.
- You usually pay this **only after** the provider sends an actual bill.

## What to do next
- [ ] If you have not received a provider bill yet, wait for it.
- [ ] When you receive a bill, confirm it matches the $120.
- [ ] If it doesn’t match, ask for an itemized bill and call the provider/insurer.
