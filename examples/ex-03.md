# Example 03 — EOB mismatch math (red flags)

## Synthetic snippet
“EOB: Total charge $1,000. Allowed $400. Plan paid $350. Patient responsibility $120. Provider: XYZ Lab. Date of service: 02/02/2026.”

## What this document is
This is an **EOB** — **an EOB is not a bill**.

## Plain-English summary
- The numbers don’t reconcile cleanly.
- If allowed is $400 and plan paid $350, a simple remainder would be $50 — but EOB shows $120.
- That may be valid (deductible/copay/other claim components), but it’s a **verification trigger**.

## Key numbers
- Total charge: $1,000  
- Allowed: $400  
- Plan paid: $350  
- Patient responsibility shown: $120

## What to do next (checklist)
- [ ] Look for deductible/copay/coinsurance lines on the full EOB.
- [ ] Check if there are multiple service lines bundled into one summary.
- [ ] Wait for the provider bill and compare amounts.
- [ ] If the bill asks for $120, confirm why it’s not the simple remainder.

## Questions to ask
- “Can you explain what makes up the $120 patient responsibility (deductible vs copay vs coinsurance)?”
- “Are there multiple service lines or adjustments not shown in the summary?”
- “Is another EOB pending for the same date of service?”

## Red flags
- Summary totals don’t match line-item totals
- Patient responsibility > (Allowed − Plan paid) without explanation in the EOB
