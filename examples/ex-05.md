# Example 05 — Duplicate charge (what to ask)

## Synthetic snippet
“Provider bill shows two identical line items for ‘Office Visit’ on 01/22/2026: $180 + $180. Total due $360. No explanation provided.”

## What this document is
This looks like a **provider bill** with a potential **duplicate charge**.

## Plain-English summary
- Two identical charges for the same service on the same date may be legitimate (separate providers) or an error.
- You should verify before paying.

## Key numbers
- Line item 1: Office Visit — $180  
- Line item 2: Office Visit — $180  
- Total due: $360

## What to do next (checklist)
- [ ] Request an **itemized bill** with service codes and provider details.
- [ ] Ask if one line is facility fee vs professional fee (common confusion).
- [ ] Compare against your EOB(s) for that date.
- [ ] Pay only after confirming which parts are valid.

## Questions to ask
- “Why are there two identical office visit charges on the same date?”
- “Is one a facility fee and one a professional fee? If yes, show that clearly.”
- “What are the CPT/HCPCS codes for each line?”

## Red flags
- No codes, no provider name per line item, unclear payee, or no explanation for duplicates
